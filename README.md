# ANN
building a complete neural network using Numpy. 
You will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

 The code is divided into the following sections for better unnderstanding:

Data preparation
Feedforward
Loss computation
Backpropagation
Parameter updates
Model training and predictions
